## About
The [Moore.io](https://www.mooreio.com) UVM Clocking Agent is a simple and vital element to any UVM test bench.  Both for driving and monitoring purposes.  This project consists of the agent (`uvma_clk_pkg`), the self-testing UVM environment (`uvme_clk_st_pkg`) and the test bench (`uvmt_clk_st_pkg`) to verify the agent against itself.
